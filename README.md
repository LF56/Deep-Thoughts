# Description
This week, we were tasked to create an application called `Deep Thoughts`. This is a full MERN stack application that was focused on the following tasks:

- Create an Apollo Server and apply it to an Express.js server as middleware.

- Modify the existing authentication middleware to work in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo server.

- Build API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application.

- Use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify server-side data.

- Successfully configure and deploy a MERN application to Heroku.

# Install

# Usage
`where users can create an account, post their thoughts for others to see, and interact with other users through these thoughts`.
